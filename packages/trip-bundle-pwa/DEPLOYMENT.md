# Trip Bundle PWA - Deployment Guide

This PWA can be deployed to two different GitHub Pages URLs:

## üöÄ Deployment URLs

After deployment, your app will be available at:

- **Current Deployment (Mock Version)**: `https://yoavtsook2806.github.io/trip-bundle/`
  - Currently serves the mock version with sample data
  - No API costs, perfect for demos and testing
  - Deploy mock version: `yarn workspace trip-bundle-pwa deploy:mock`

- **Production Version (Future)**: `https://yoavtsook2806.github.io/trip-bundle/`
  - Same URL, but will serve production version when deployed
  - Uses real OpenAI API calls, requires valid API key
  - Deploy production version: `yarn workspace trip-bundle-pwa deploy:prod`

## üìã Deployment Commands

### Test Locally First (RECOMMENDED)
```bash
# Build and test mock version locally
yarn workspace trip-bundle-pwa build:mock
yarn workspace trip-bundle-pwa serve:local

# Build and test production version locally
yarn workspace trip-bundle-pwa build:prod
yarn workspace trip-bundle-pwa serve:local
```

### Deploy Mock Version Only
```bash
yarn workspace trip-bundle-pwa deploy:mock
```

### Deploy Production Version Only
```bash
yarn workspace trip-bundle-pwa deploy:prod
```

### Deploy Both Versions
```bash
yarn workspace trip-bundle-pwa deploy:both
```

## üîß How It Works

1. **Mock Build**: `build:mock` - Sets `VITE_MOCK=true` and `GITHUB_PAGES=true`
2. **Production Build**: `build:prod` - Sets `GITHUB_PAGES=true` only
3. **Single Branch Deployment**: 
   - Both mock and production versions deploy to `gh-pages` branch
   - GitHub Pages serves from `gh-pages` branch at `/trip-bundle/` path
   - You choose which version to deploy (mock vs production)

## üåê GitHub Pages Setup

GitHub Pages is configured to serve from:
- **Source**: `gh-pages` branch (root)
- **URL**: `https://yoavtsook2806.github.io/trip-bundle/`
- **Current**: Mock version (sample data, no API costs)

## üß™ Local Testing

**ALWAYS test locally before deploying!**

1. **Build the version you want to test:**
   ```bash
   yarn workspace trip-bundle-pwa build:mock  # or build:prod
   ```

2. **Serve locally:**
   ```bash
   yarn workspace trip-bundle-pwa serve:local
   ```

3. **Open in browser:** http://localhost:8080

4. **Test key features:**
   - App loads without errors
   - PWA manifest works
   - Service worker registers
   - All routes/tabs work
   - Mock data displays (for mock build)
   - API calls work (for prod build with real API keys)

## üõ†Ô∏è Environment Variables

For production deployment, ensure these are set:
- `VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY` - Your OpenAI API key
- `VITE_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` - Spotify client ID (optional)
- `VITE_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET` - Spotify client secret (optional)

## üì± PWA Features

Both deployed versions include:
- ‚úÖ Service Worker for offline functionality
- ‚úÖ Web App Manifest for installation
- ‚úÖ Responsive design for all devices
- ‚úÖ Local storage for user preferences
- ‚úÖ Tab navigation between trips and preferences

## üéØ Recommended Usage

- **Demo/Testing**: Use mock version to showcase features
- **Production**: Use production version with real API for actual trip planning
- **Development**: Test both versions before releases
